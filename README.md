#  Project Generate Faces

### [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Udacity


In this project we had to build a [Generative Adversarial Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_networks) that can generate novel faces when trained on the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). 

#### Topics covered

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
- Deep Convolutional GANs
